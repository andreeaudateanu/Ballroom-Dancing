                        <div class="descr">During the early modern period, the first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the <strong>16th century</strong>, when <em>Jehan Tabourot</em>, under the pen name <em>"Thoinot-Arbeau"</em>, published in <strong>1588</strong> his Orch√©sographie, a study of late <strong>16th-century</strong> French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn basse danse, the livelier branle, pavane, and the galliarde which <em>Shakespeare</em> called the "cinq pace" as it was made of five steps.</div>

                        <div class="descr">The <em>Minuet</em>, originally a peasant dance of <em>Poitou</em>, was introduced into <em>Paris</em> and set to music by <em>Jean-Baptiste Lully</em> and danced by the <em>King Louis XIV</em> in public. The <em>Minuet</em> dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the <strong>18th century</strong>.</div>

                        <div class="descr"><em>Carl Maria von Weber</em> wrote Invitation to the Dance, which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened.</div>

                        <div class="descr">Several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the polka, mazurka, and the Schottische. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as entrechats and ronds de jambes that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.</div>

                        <div class="descr">The on-screen dance pairing of <em>Fred Astaire</em> and <em>Ginger Rogers</em> influenced all forms of dance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status. Much of <em>Astaire and Rogers'</em> work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by <em>Astaire or Hermes Pan</em>) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.</div>
