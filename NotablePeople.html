                                <p>Astaire studied dancing from the age of four, and in 1906 he formed an act with his sister, Adele, that became a popular vaudeville attraction. The two made their Broadway debut in Over the Top (1917-18). They achieved international fame with stage hits that included For Goodness Sake (1922), Funny Face (1927-28), and The Band Wagon (1931-32).</p>

                                <p><strong>Age: 51</strong></p>
                                <p>Charlotte Jorgensen was on the very first season of "Dancing With The Stars", where she was partnered with John O'Hurley. They went to the finals and ultimately lost to Kelly Monaco and Alec Mazo. There was quite a bit of talk that Charlotte and John actually deserved to win, so after the competition was over, ABC aired a "dance-off" between the two teams. In the end, Charlotte and John were victorious. However, this did not change the fact that Kelly and Alec were credited as the first season champions.Jorgensen and O'Hurley released the Bayview Films Ballroom instructional video Learn to Dance with John and Charlotte on July 31, 2007.</p>

                                <p><strong>Age: 64</strong></p>
                                <p>Donnie Burns and his former partner Gaynor Fairweather were 16-time World Professional Latin champions: this is by some way the record for this title. They were also eleven times International Latin American Dance Champions, and this is also a record. On their competitive retirement both were honoured by appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1991 Birthday Honours. Donnie was undefeated in any competitive dance contest for nearly 20 years of continuous competition, a record in any major category of ballroom dance; this is now in the Guinness Book of Records. During this period he won major titles in countries throughout the world.</p>
